- Monitor and respond to conversations in real-time with context-aware replies.
- Analyze account behavior, personalities, and engagement patterns.
- Summarize threads, distilling key points and actionable insights.
- Perform trend analysis to understand sentiment and identify key influencers.

This transforms Timeless AI into a dynamic, real-time conversational analyst.
